# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **predicting stock prices** using time-series data and machine learning models implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`). It includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and future price prediction.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📊 Load and visualize historical stock data  
- 🧹 Clean and preprocess raw stock datasets  
- 🏗️ Feature engineering and data scaling  
- 🤖 Apply machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Linear Regression)  
- 🔮 Predict future stock prices  
- 📈 Visualize real vs. predicted prices  
- 💡 Jupyter notebook format for reproducible experiments

---

## 🧠 Models Used
📌 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks

📌 Linear Regression

📌 Random Forest Regressor (optional)

📌 Moving Averages or Technical Indicators (optional)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
2. Install Required Libraries
Use pip to install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
If you don’t have Jupyter installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install notebook
3. Run the Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
This will launch Jupyter in your browser where you can run the code cell-by-cell.

## 📊 Data Source
This project uses stock market data which can be obtained via:

✅ Yahoo Finance (using yfinance)

✅ Custom CSV datasets

Example (using yfinance):

python
Copy
Edit
import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2015-01-01', end='2024-12-31')
🔧 Customization

Feature	Description
Stock Ticker	Change the ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL', 'GOOGL')
Date Range	Modify the start and end dates
Time Window	Adjust sequence length for LSTM
Future Steps	Modify the prediction horizon
Model Choice	Swap out or experiment with different ML models
